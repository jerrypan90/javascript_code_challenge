# Rail Fence Cipher

You're going to implement a simple [Rail Fence Cipher](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rail_fence)

Write a function `encode` that takes a string and encodes it using a Rail Fence Cipher with 3 rails. You can assume no spaces and all input is valid. For example:

```
WEAREDISCOVEREDFLEEATONCE => WECRLTEERDSOEEFEAOCAIVDEN
```
