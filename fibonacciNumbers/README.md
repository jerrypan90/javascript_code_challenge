# Fibonacci Numbers

Write a function that generates and returns the n-th fibonacci number.

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number):

> In mathematics, the Fibonacci numbers are the numbers in the following integer sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence, and characterized by the fact that every number after the first two is the sum of the two preceding ones.

These are the first 8 fibonacci numbers:

```
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ...
```

Therefore `fibonacci(8)` should dynamically calculate and return the value 13.
